## Description

The app can be used to add/edit heavy metal festival listings around the world. Users can tick off festivals that have been attended, edit the start/end dates, check current weather conditions and upload images of their fun times which are then stored in Cloudinary. Users can also categorise the festivals by musical genre(s). 

Project will be amended going forward for future assignment work.
